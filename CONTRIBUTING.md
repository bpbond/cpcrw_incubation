**tl;dr** We welcome contributions, but they become our property when made. We alone judge when contributions merit formal acknowledgment or co-authorship, and do so following standard scientific norms.

# How to contribute

We welcome outside contributions. In particular, we're happy to have mistakes pointed out, other analyses suggested, and better ways to do things brought to our attention. In advance, *thank you*!

That said, this repository does differ in subtle ways from a typical open-source software project. Specifically, we reserve to ourselves sole discretion about when contributions merit co-authorship on papers and other research products, versus formal acknowledgment, versus just a "hey, thanks!" in an issue. In other words, because we have a lot of work invested in this project, and the end product is quite valuable career-wise, we need to be deliberate about which contributions we accept, and how they're rewarded.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* **Open an issue** (after making sure one does not already exist) describing your question or proposed change.
* Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
* Interact with the project maintainers to refine/change/prioritize your issue. We may then invite a pull request (below), or may not.
* Trivial changes to comments or documentation do not require creating a new issue.

## Making Changes

* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Follow the repository's existing coding style (see files for examples).
* Make sure your commit messages are descriptive but succinct, describing what was changed and why, and **reference the relevant issue number**. Make commits of logical units.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request.
* **Your pull request should include the following statement**: You hereby grant PNNL unlimited license to use this code, or ideas in your submission, in this experiment. You reserve all other rights.
* We look at Pull Requests on a regular basis, and will respond as soon as possible.
