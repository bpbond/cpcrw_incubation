#### Introduction

Look at - Ruegg et al. paper on data life cycle!
Data paper - https://peerj.com/preprints/1448/

#### Why more openness in science?

* Reproducibility

Thornton paper on archiving models

* Data loss

17% per year paper - Vines et al.

* Data quality

"All bugs are shallow" Raymond quote

* Increasing transparency of the process - increase public trust and access to science

* Value of collected databases - makes this easier
* BAAD TRY, FLUXNET, Dong-Gill, SRDB

#### Push and pull: funders, journals, and society

PLOS ONE, ESA, etc. policies

* NSF url
* DOE url
* NASA url
* NSERC, Wellcome trust, other?

#### Running a fully open experiment: one example

* GitHub
* Diagnostics page(s)
* Data: raw to summarized to final
* All statistical analyses
* "LRB" - notes 
* Manuscript(s)

#### Conclusions


This model not appropriate for everyone/thing!

Potential concerns

* Not appropriate for every kind of study
* Fear of "being scooped"
* Question of open from beginning or only after publication
* Privacy concerns
