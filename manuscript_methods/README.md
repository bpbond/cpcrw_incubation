## Introduction

Look at - Ruegg et al. paper on data life cycle!
Data paper - https://peerj.com/preprints/1448/
http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002295

### Reproducibility

Thornton paper on archiving models

### Data loss

17% per year paper - Vines et al.

### Data quality

"All bugs are shallow" Raymond quote

### Journals are pushing

PLOS ONE, ESA, etc. policies

### Funders are pushing
Push for open data and reproducible methods

* NSF url
* DOE url
* NASA url
* NSERC, Wellcome trust, other?

### Importance

Work funded by public agencies
Increasing transparency of the process - increase public trust and access to science?

### Previous, similar efforts

* BAAD

## What our setup looked like

* GitHub
* Diagnostics page(s)
* Data: raw to summarized to final
* All statistical analyses
* "LRB" - notes 
* Manuscript(s)

## Conclusions

### Potential concerns

* Not appropriate for every kind of study (e.g....)
* Privacy concerns
*
