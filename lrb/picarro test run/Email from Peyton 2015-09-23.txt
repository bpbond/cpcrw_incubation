The first run has 2 min core, followed by 1 min ambient for 3 different cores, run in duplicate
Then there is a 'normal' run of those 3 cores measured for 2 minutes one right after the other. 

If you have time and feel like seeing if it makes a difference in our measurements, feel free to play around with it and let me know the results. 
Thanks.
