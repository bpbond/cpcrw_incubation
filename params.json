We're interested in how production of these gases varies with soil moisture, temperature, and structural and biological characteristics of the soils themselves.\r\n\r\nThis work is part of a larger project led by Vanessa Bailey, Ben Bond-Lamberty, and Chongxuan Liu, \"Pore- to Core-Scale Research to Inform Ecosystem-Scale Soil C Biogeochemistry\" at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. It is funded by DOE's [Terrestrial Ecosystem Science Program](http://tes.science.energy.gov).\r\n\r\n\r\n![Looking down a sample hole](https://github.com/bpbond/cpcrw_incubation/images/hole.jpg)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
