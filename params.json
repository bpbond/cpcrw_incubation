We're interested in how production of these gases varies with soil moisture, temperature, and structural and biological characteristics of the soils themselves.\r\n\r\nhttps://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1956468/9818309/e138bddc-5875-11e5-9433-34ead3339cf3.png\r\n\r\nThis work is part of a larger project led by Vanessa Bailey, Ben Bond-Lamberty, and Chongxuan Liu, \"Pore- to Core-Scale Research to Inform Ecosystem-Scale Soil C Biogeochemistry\" at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
