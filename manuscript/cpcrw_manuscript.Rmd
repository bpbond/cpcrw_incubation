#### Abstract

Peyton text to use in abstract:
>The goal of this study was to characterize the chemical and biological properties of sub-Arctic, active layer soils subjected to changes in temperature and moisture. We also sought to determine the relative control temperature and moisture have on the fate of C and greenhouse gas emissions in active layer soils lying directly above permafrost. We measured carbon dioxide and methane emissions on soil at two different temperatures (4 and 20C) and moisture contents (field moist and drought-induced) throughout a 100-day incubation. We also determined soil structure, extracellular enzyme activity, total nitrogen, carbon, and the molecular composition of C pre and post-incubation cores. We hypothesized that the field moist 20˚C cores have a greater potential to lose C as both CO2 and CH4 than cores held at 4˚C due to increased aerobic and anaerobic microbial activity. We also hypothesize that drought-induced cores will have a higher potential to lose more ‘complex’ carbon compounds (aromatic-C) as these compounds are desorbed due to increased surface tension.

#### Introduction

* Boreal biome and climate change.
 * Climate change and warming boreal biome.
 * Variety of changes occurring - Alaska in particular.
 * Vegetation transitions (setting up for transition zone sampling).

* Potential soils and permafrost C feedback. 
 * Soils hold a lot of C, particularly at high latitudes.
 * Importance of active layer.
 * Uncertainty of climate feedback.

* Moisture likely to be a strong control of C oxidation.
 * Cite theoretical, experimental, modeling work here. 
 * Soil drainage/anoxia is *highly* uncertain.
 * Will determine both magnitude and form (CO2/CH4) of oxidation.
 * This will have different feedback effects.

* Goals of this study.
 * Sample AL soils at maximum AL depth, vegetation transition zone (high enough to warm, still lots of C).
 * Manipulative experiment (drought and temperature) examining CO2/CH4 emissions.
 * Link to structural/biological measurements.

The goal of this study was to characterize the chemical and biological properties of sub-Arctic, active layer soils subjected to changes in temperature and moisture. We also sought to determine the relative control temperature and moisture have on the fate of C and greenhouse gas emissions in active layer soils lying directly above permafrost. We hypothesized that the field moist 20˚C cores have a greater potential to lose C as both CO2 and CH4 than cores held at 4˚C due to increased aerobic and anaerobic microbial activity. We also hypothesized that drought-induced cores would have a higher potential to lose more ‘complex’ carbon compounds (aromatic C) as these compounds are desorbed due to increased surface tension.

 
#### Methods

**Field sampling**

The field component of this research took place in Caribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed (CPCRW), part of the Bonanza Creek LTER (http://www.lter.uaf.edu/default.cfm). Annual average air temperature was 􏰀3.3°C, and the average temperature in July was 16.4°C, which was the maximum in this watershed. Annual average precipitation was 269 mm, and the average precipitation of 47 mm in August was the highest in this area. 

SE slope, transition zone...

of this study site was more than TODO years according to the tree rings at stem base. Stand density of dominant Picea mariana and glauca trees (>1.3 m in height) was TODO trees ha^-1^, with a basal area of TODO m^2^ ha^-1^.

Thirty-nine soil cores, each 30 cm high by 7.5 cm wide, were taken using a soil recovery augur (AMS Inc., American Falls, ID) on 3-5 August 2015. We sampled from the bottom (within 0-2 cm) of the active layer, which averaged 80 cm depth. Sample points were randomly located in the transition zone described above, and separated by 2-5 m. The soil is characterized as a poorly-drained silt loam, and on average had ~20 cm of organic material over the mineral soil. Cores were kept cool in the field before being packed in dry ice and shipped to the lab in Richland, WA within 48-72 hours of collection.

**Laboratory incubation**

In the lab, the soil cores were stored at 4 &deg;C for several days until they were weighed and prepared for incubation. At that point (11-12 August 2015), three fragmented or otherwise damaged cores were discarded, and the remaining cores were randomly assigned to one of six groups (each N=6). These groups included two incubation temperatures (4 &deg;C and 20 &deg;C) each with two moisture treatments: one in which soil moisture was maintained at field conditions (~28% moisture by volume), and a drought treatment in which no water was added and cores were allowed to dry down to ~5% moisture by volume. The fifth group was a 20 &deg;C "controlled drought" one, in which water was added so that these cores' moisture status closely matched those of the 4 &deg;C "drought" group. The final group includedsix cores for destructive, pre-incubation measurements including moisture content, pH, soil carbon and nitrogen, and bulk density. Subsamples were collected and stored at -20 &deg;C for potential enzyme activity and ATP.

On 18 August 2015 cores were placed into one of two growth chambers (Conviron CMP6050 Control Systems, Winnipeg, Canada) maintained at 4 and 20 &deg;C temperatures and 70% relative humidity and allowed to equilibrate for two weeks. Starting on 31 August 2015 we measured the cores' mass and GHG (CH~4~ and CO~2~) evolution four times in the first week, then twice per week for the first month, and then once per week for the rest of the 100-day incubation. Throughout the incubation, cores were mounted on 0.05-MPa ceramic plates (Soil Moisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA) so that, when the plates were placed in contact with water, water would move up into the cores via capillary action and to moderate the drying of the 20 &deg;C "controlled drought" group. To maintain the field moisture treatment groups at ~28% moisture, the cores sat on saturated pore plates and received additional wetting from the top of the cores to supplement for when evaporation exceeded imbibition.

For each measurement, a six-core treatment group was connected to a Picarro A0311 multiplexer that was in turn connected to a Picarro G2301 GHG Analyzer (Picarro Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Dry GHG concentration were monitored for 2 minutes, and this was repeated 2-3 times before moving on to a new treatment group. Ambient air was measured between treatment groups, and before starting measurements in a chamber.

**Statistical analysis**

AOutlier exclusion based on 3.2 mean absolute deviations from treatment and temperature mean. We excluded X of Y (Z%) of the summarized samples for this reason.
